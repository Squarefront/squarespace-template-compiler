The argument delimiter for a formatter is the first character
after the formatter's name.  In the case below its a space ' ' char.
{timestamp|date %Y}

This is fine for most purposes, as we rarely have spaces inside the
argument itself.
{timestamp|date %H:%M:%S}

But suppose we want spaces in the output of the date formatter. We 
just need to pick a delimiter character that won't appear in the 
format string:
{timestamp|date:%Y %m %d}

Here's another variant, where we want to use both spaces and colons in
the output:
{timestamp|date,%Y %m %d %H:%M:%S}

The only other character we can't use is PIPE '|' since its used to 
pipe output to the next formatter:
{timestamp|date,%Y %m %d %H:%M:%S|json-pretty}
